# AI-ParticleSwarmOptimization


Developed a 2D interface for visualizing particle movement in a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm used to solve optimization problems. Implemented the plotting of particle positions in real-time and documented the project. The PSO algorithm was employed to find the global minimum of a function by simulating social behavior in a multi-dimensional search space.
